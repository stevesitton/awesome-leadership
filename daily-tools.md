# Daily Tools

These are the tools or apps I frequently use for productivity and keeping up to date:

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) - used daily to move windows to snap areas
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com) - used for work notes, especially 1:1s. Useful working across devices. Not entirely convinced but haven't found a good alternative.
- [Keep](https://www.google.com/keep) - mainly for personal notes. It's lightweight and quick to capture what's on my mind
- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) - so good for sending articles, blogs, twitter threads to to read another time
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com) - RSS feed, my way to stay up to date, works well across devices
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - excellent password manager, free tier works across all my devices
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) - music and podcasts

## Miscellaneous tools

- [removebg](https://www.remove.bg/) - remove the background from an image
- [uncreen](https://www.unscreen.com/) - remove the background from a video
