## Areas to consider

- Take time to think about both what people accomplished and how they went about accomplishing it. 
- Think about what each of your employees did that year that you want them to do more of next year, and what you'd like them to stop.
- Think about how you can take the best of what each person delivered this year and build on it next year.
- Think about all the moments that mattered, and what part each employee played. And then share this feedback, because it matters.
- Where have they had the most impact over the past year?
- What could you have done better in the past year?
- Share with them how their work has helped others
